This was a class project (CS310 Data Structures and Algorithims) simulating a computer network, without using any libraries/frameworks. Built a hashtable with seprate chaining, and a graph data structure.

## Assignment Objectives
- Write a program which simulates a computer network.
- Create and use a _graph_ data structure.
- Create and use a _hash table_ data structure.
- Apply basic knowledge of Big-O trade offs.

## Assignment Overview
Professional code often uses existing libraries to quickly prototype interesting programs. You are going to use 2-3 established libraries to quickly develop the internal representation of two advanced data structures (a graph and a hash table) and simulate a simple computer network.

The three libraries you are going to use are:
1. Your previous project code - You have written a number of simple data structures in this class and you are welcome to continue using these as part of this project.
2. The Java Collections Framework - This is a collection of existing simple data structures (lists, queues, etc.) which can form the basis for more advanced data structures.
3. A subset of [JUNG](http://jung.sourceforge.net/) (Java Universal Network/Graph Framework) - This library provides a lot of cool visualization tools for graphs: automatic layouts for graphs, an easy interface for creating/editing graphs, and much more.
